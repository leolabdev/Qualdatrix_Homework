## Description

This project is a full-stack course subscription management application built using React for the frontend and NestJS for the backend. The system allows users to browse available courses, subscribe to them, and manage their subscriptions. Admins or course creators can add or delete courses. The application also supports drag-and-drop functionality for easy course subscription management.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Backend Setup**:
    - Navigate to the `backend` folder and follow the instructions in the backend's `README.md`.
    - Ensure the backend server is running before starting the frontend.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
    - After setting up the backend, navigate to the `frontend` folder.
    - Follow the instructions in the frontend's `README.md` to install dependencies and start the development server.

The backend and frontend are designed to work together, so ensure both are running simultaneously for the best experience.
